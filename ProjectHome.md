The IJBlob library indentifying [connected components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Component_Labeling) in binary images. The algorithm used for connected component labeling is:

Chang, F. (2004). A linear-time component-labeling algorithm using contour tracing technique. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 93(2), 206â€“220. doi:10.1016/j.cviu.2003.09.002


A connected component is a set of pixels which are connected by its 8-neigherhood and is often called a "blob". An Example:

The image above contains 8 marked blobs. Also the holes (and the contours of the holes) of the two Bs and the O are identified. It is also possible to get a color labeled image:

In addition nested objects are identified:

The ImageJ **Shape Filter Plugin** (see downloads) uses this library for flitering the blobs by its shape.

## Features of IJBlob ##
**IJBlob 1.1 introduces a filter and extension framework! Please see the [HowToUSE](https://code.google.com/p/ijblob/wiki/HowToUSE) for more information**

  * Extract the outer contour of each blob.
  * Extracts also all inner contours of each blob (holes).
  * Detects also nested objects (blob in blob).
  * Calculates BasicFeatures of the blob.
